/home/juhwan/workspace/.otx/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mmcv/__init__.py:20: UserWarning: On January 1, 2023, MMCV will release v2.0.0, in which it will remove components related to the training process and add a data transformation module. In addition, it will rename the package names mmcv to mmcv-lite and mmcv-full to mmcv. See https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/blob/master/docs/en/compatibility.md for more details.
